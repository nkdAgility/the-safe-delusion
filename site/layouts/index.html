                      Now that Agile passed the early adopter stage, there are many companies interested in adopting it, and many practitioners interested in learning it. Yet those companies and practitioners without extensive Agile experience have a hard
                      time evaluating what will bring them value and what not. The information collected in this document is to help them make an informed decision.

                      Many of the larger companies and novice practitioners look at the marketing from SAFe, and they don’t know if they can trust it or not. In this document members of the Agile community are collecting available information including on
                      these marketing stories. Some practitioners have been there and know the difference between marketing and real stories, others know not only how things started yet also how things are going now.

                        In a highly publicised move, Scaled Agile Inc offered free consulting to address the concerns from the memorandum. Later the USAF CSO confirmed the conclusions from the memorandum were still standing, and SAFe was still strongly
                        discouraged and will not be used in any form in their DevSecOps Initiative.

                      <p class="text-muted">
                        Fitbit Inc. is an American company founded in 2007 with its headquarters in San Francisco. It now has about 15 offices around the world. In 2019 Fitbit was reported to have sold more than 100 million devices and have 28 million
                        users. Between 2015 and 2016 FitBit adopted SAFe.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        Damian Brown, Sr. Director of Program Management Office, describes the success of SAFe citing criteria, such as processes and teams’ Velocity, that are irrelevant for Agile teams and show a lack of paradigm shift or an Agile
                        mindset. He continues commenting on the company's growth and the commercial success of the new products released. But the financial data, reports from financial analysts and other publicly available data contradict that.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        A person working at FitBit confirmed the lack of autonomy of the teams. And added that later FitBit had abandoned SAFe, and the person that had persuaded the company to try it had left the company as well. The FitBit case study is
                        still listed on the SAFe website as a success story. This story seems far from being a success.

                      <p class="text-muted">Volvo Cars were founded in 1927. It is headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. It has around 40,000 employees and produces around 700,000 cars per year.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">In software development, it employs about 10,000 people with about 150 million lines of code per car. Nowadays, cars are steadily becoming “computers on wheels”.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Between 2017 and the end of 2019, Volvo Cars went through 2 years and a half Agile transformation phase to scale Agile with SAFe.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        In a 2020 interview with the Head of Continuous Improvement &amp; Change at Product Creation, there is evidence of a lack of focus on technical excellence as instead suggested by the Agile principles. The interview also reveals a
                        focus on processes and a hierarchical top-down approach, but no focus on the Agile mindset.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        Two academic case studies by the Chalmers University Of Technology also confirm the lack of focus on the Agile mindset and the lack of alignment with Lean and Agile principles, a hierarchical approach with an org chart made deeper
                        by additional levels. One of the papers also notes the inflexibility of SAFe and its disadvantages.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Three years later, Volvo Cars is still using SAFe in several parts of the organisation.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        In September 2022, an internal source confirmed that a whole department in Volvo dropped SAFe after it became obvious to them it wasn't adding value. Since then , the teams have been functioning in a fairly Agile way in spite of
                        the SAFe limitations: the PI planning was becoming mostly for show , and the real organisation of the work and the collaboration was happening much more fluidly; the program board was adding very little value in the face of the
                        significant effort spent for it.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">This change involved 11 teams and just over 100 people ,including Product Owners, Software Developers, UX designers, graphic designers, subject matter experts, etc.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">They wanted to honour how the teams want to continuously plan and not just how they want to work, empowering teams to apply pressure upwards through the organisation in order to continuously improve.</p>

                      <p class="text-muted">ANZ, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited is an Australian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">In 2016 SAFe was rolled out in one part of ANZ, says Sam Kline.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">In an event sponsored by Scaled Agile Inc. and one of their premium implementation partners, the rollout has been listed among some of Australia’s most successful SAFe implementations.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        A second and bigger initiative started in 2017. In 2017, CEO Shayne Elliott wanted to reshape the bank’s staid culture to give ANZ customers more and faster by introducing Agile. Shayne Elliott was taking inspiration from what
                        technology companies from Amazon to Microsoft did and looking at what some banks such as ING and ABN Amro had been doing although with mixed results. He focused on processes implementing an approach for scaling Agile across its
                        Australian division and focused on tools: through an enterprise agreement with Atlassian for the use of Jira and Confluence.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        In a 2018 article by Michael Gibson, Senior Analytics Delivery Lead in ANZ, there is a reference to SAFe suggesting that there was still some influence from SAFe ideas at that time. In another 2018 article Jean Dieudonne, Product
                        Owner and Business Owners Tribe at ANZ, mentions a copy-paste approach of elements of the Spotify model and a reference to McKinsey’s articles containing several misrepresentations of Agile.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        To summarise, both initiatives aimed at scaling Agile instead of achieving Agility at scale. The first initiative relied on a proven recipe, and the second initiative relied on copying and tailoring solutions from other
                        organisations instead of growing and evolving their own approach based on the specific needs, context, and circumstances of ANZ.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">All things that nowadays Agile experts strongly advise against.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        Despite promises that the 2017 initiative would lead to “agile” teams delivering a digital transformation to generate growth and underpin the bank’s residential mortgage business, five years later, the bank’s technology systems
                        still lag behind its biggest competitors. This may be inferred from the bank’s home loan approval systems becoming one of the slowest in Australia, and for that ANZ lost a substantial share of the $2 trillion mortgage market, its
                        share price is down 17 per cent since Elliott became CEO seven years ago.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Martin North, the founder of DFA Analytics, says “I don’t rate ANZ as an agile organisation. In fact, I would say that they’re quite sluggish in terms of some of the things that they’re doing.”</p>

                      So far all the SAFe case studies that allow for some form of verification or third-party observations all show that SAFe does not make the organisation more agile, it worsened the shortcomings that are typical of the pre-Agile
                      approaches, and overall makes things worse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">It is also known that SAFe isn’t used by any leading software commercial organisations such as Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, and the like.</p>

                      <p class="text-muted">Al Shalloway has been one of the three initial SAFe Principal Contributors for six years, the first SAFe program consultant trainer (SPCT) outside Scaled Agile Inc, and his company was a SAFe Gold partner.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        In 2018 he broke off his relationship with Scaled Agile Inc and SAFe, citing among the reasons that SAFe has grown considerably more complex than it needed to be, and that he was told had to prove he had done a few “by the book”
                        SAFe adoptions to renew his SPCT certification.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        Mr. Shalloway’s view is that SAFe brings some very useful concepts to Agile – Flow/Lean (although not well implemented, but at least mentioned), big room planning to start a large scale (over 300 people) adoption of Agile, DevOps,
                        an overall value stream view, large room planning when it’s useful, and more. However, while it is a good first step for very large organisations that can’t deliver in 3 months, it is not a good approach for any company with less
                        than 500 developers. And it usually stagnates after 3 -6 months, often leaving companies worse off than when they started.
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                        SAFe starts well by getting people into Agile Release Trains, identifying dependencies, and keeping work below capacity for 1 to 2 program increments.. But this is just a first step, and without further decomposition of ARTs and a
                        simpler product management system based on minimum business increments, it reverts back into a push model where the waste that results comes back.

                        Bob Galen became SAFe SPC certified around 2013. He tried to understand, support, and apply it, but then he struggled with it for a long time to the point that he just couldn’t be associated with it any longer.

                        In his farewell to SAFe he mentioned several reasons, here are a few: It’s too big; It creates far too many roles, layers, flows, etc; It’s too focused on certifications and training; It created lazy organisations who think the
                        framework does the heavy lifting for them; It created a community of SPC’s and other consultants who look at every problem and thinks SAFe is the solution.

                        into Lean UX don’t seem to exist in SAFe.”

                        Based on what his clients are being taught by their SAFe trainers/consultants they are unable to see how SAFe and Lean UX can mix together. Neither does he have any good answers for them, since deviating from the framework is
                        considered heresy in most cases.

                        is a fundamental philosophical schism between Scrum and SAFe because Scrum controls risk through empiricism while SAFe tries to control risk through predictability.

                        of management is to do anything to help them do so, not suffocate them with SAFe.

                        did, he’d be pretty certain their top talent would leave.

                        <li>SAFe approaches to estimation is more predictive than empirical as in Agile</li>
                        <li>SAFe focus more on output and volume than the value created and delivered</li>

                        <li>SAFe Roles add more bureaucracy, disempower the teams, and make collaboration harder</li>
                        <li>PI Planning hinders business-tech collaboration, accommodates dependencies instead of removing them, and perpetuates a top-down pre-Agile approach</li>

                        When I first heard of SAFe, I was hearing the same kind of negative things as I heard when I first heard of Scrum. (From people doing XP) or Kanban (from people doing scrum). So I decided to look for a SAFe project to experience it
                        myself. As I did not want to just have an opinion based on theory. After that project my general feeling was: SAFe goes further than the companies implementing it want to go and does not go as far as what the companies really need.
                        I saw that at best it was a gateway drug to agile. Yet in most companies it just gives a new name for an old way of working. A nice example is dependencies, instead of making dependencies transparent to start working on removing
                        them, they at best visualise them so show them as reality. I used to think it was nice they showed many different techniques to a large audience. Now I see that not only they explain them badly and give practitioners a bad start
                        with a new technique, they also try to copyright techniques from agile friends. The sentence “this is not agile”, is not agile in itself, yet calling a cat a dog, does not make it bark.

                    <p class="lead">The adoption of SAFe and its market share are still growing.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The less flattering trends below come from anecdotal evidence.</p>
                    <p>There is a growing number of Agile professionals and certified SAFe professionals that decided not to work again with clients adopting SAFe. They declared it publicly, it</p>
                    <p>occasionally comes up at meetings among Agile professionals, and some recruiters reported candidates refusing job opportunities because of SAFe.</p>
                    <p>The number of experienced Agile professionals publicly criticising SAFe is also increasing.</p>
                    <p>There is a growing number of sr leaders and former employees of organisations that tried to adopt SAFe that are sharing stories of stalled and abandoned adoptions, adoptions that went wrong, and problems caused by SAFe.</p>
                    <p>The number and frequency of posts on social media and articles in online magazines about failed SAFe adoptions is also increasing.</p>
                    <p>More organisations are asking for Agile professionals that are framework agnostic, and that have enough experience to work without the need of a guardrail from a scaled framework.</p>
                    <p>
                      It is not possible to say if these trends are ordinary by-products of the increasing adoptions of SAFe, if they are due to SAFe itself, the quality of its implementations, the characteristic of the organisations choosing that
                      framework, or other factors.
